# 🎮 3D Cyberpunk Pong Game using Unity

A futuristic and immersive take on the classic **Pong**, built entirely in **Unity 3D** using **C#**.  
This project was developed as part of a college submission and demonstrates a beginner-friendly yet professional approach to **game design, scripting, and visual polish** in Unity.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The **3D Cyberpunk Pong Game** blends the simplicity of traditional Pong with a high-tech, neon-lit cyberpunk atmosphere.  
The game features two rackets (one controlled by a player, the other by AI), a physics-based ball, real-time scoring, and countdown-based gameplay.  
It showcases Unity fundamentals — from physics and input systems to UI design and event-driven scripting — while applying software engineering best practices.

This project aims to provide a **comprehensive learning experience** for beginners in game development and highlight how modular design principles can lead to clean, scalable, and fun games.
